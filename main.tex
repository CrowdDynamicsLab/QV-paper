\begin{abstract}
  Decision-makers frequently aggregate self-reported data from the crowd to inform their decisions. One common case of collective decision-making involves prioritizing a subset of given options under resource constraints. Researchers have developed a wide range of surveying techniques, such as ratings and rankings approaches, over the past century. However, it remains a challenge to eliciting accurate and rich self-reported responses in a resource-constrained context. In this study, we examine Quadratic Voting (QV), a voting mechanism recently developed by \textcite{posner2018radical}, as an alternative online survey technique and argue that it could elicit self-reported responses more accurately compared to Likert scale when the survey goal is to understand relative preferences under resource constraints. We conducted two randomized controlled experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk, one in the context of public opinion polling and the other in a human-computer interaction user study. Based on our Bayesian analysis results, a QV survey with a sufficient amount of voice credits, aligned significantly closer to participants' incentive-compatible behaviors, than a Likert scale survey, with a medium to high effect size. In addition, we extended QV's application scenario from typical public policy and education research to a problem setting familiar to the CSCW community: a prototypical HCI user study. Our experiment results, QV survey design, and QV interface serve as a stepping stone for CSCW researchers to further explore this surveying methodology in their studies and encourage decision-makers from other communities to consider QV as a promising alternative.
