% \section{Limitations} \label{future}
% Like all experiments completed over the internet, it is difficult for us to control and verify that participants answered the questions truthfully and carefully. However, we implemented many gating features and introduced incentive-compatible experimental tasks to mitigate this impact. As we mentioned in the discussion section, another limitation lies in the limited ability to compare ordinal Likert survey data with scalar data.

% \subsection{Behavior when casting votes} % slightly boring
% It is important to point out that Despite only occurring once (\texttt{P1d659}), we think the term ``voting'' might motivate participants to consider how a collective decision was made.
% %scenere voting might not happen in QV?, mentioned in the voting chapter
% This participant mentioned ``[\textellipsis] I thought a lot of people would probably support faith and spiritual ecatagory  so I watned to try to counterbalance that by voting against it.'' The participants are willing to pay the cost by devoting fewer votes for issues they care and vote against specific ballots. This behavior is not possible in a Likert survey. This requires further experiments to understand how people's mental model works when voting under QV. \par 

% \subsection{Ease of use}
% In addition, we do not have enough understanding of the level of usability of QV from two aspects.
% First, we are not sure how easy it is for participants to understand QV.
% In our experiment, participants are far more familiar with Likert-scaled surveys compared to QV, placing a lighter cognitive load.
% We acknowledge that participants need additional time and effort to understand and utilize QV throughout our experiment, yet, it is unclear if education level and prior experiences impact participants' understanding of QV and their final choices.
% Second, we do not know if there exists diminished effectiveness of QV if there are large amounts of options, meaning selecting a few over hundreds of options.
