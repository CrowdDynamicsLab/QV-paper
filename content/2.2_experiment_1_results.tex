\subsubsection{Quantitative Analysis Results}

-- raw data
    describe dataset, total # of participants in each group before and after dataset cleaning, demographics of each group;
    
    donation descriptive statistics: perc of non-zero donation, total donation amount comparison across groups (discuss our test of checking if other factors impacts total donation amount -> absolute vs. normalized donation amount), donation distribution across topics between groups
    
    QV & Likert votes descriptive statistics: votes distribution per topic across groups, budget usage distribution across QV groups
    
-- data transformation to alignment measurement
    describe calculation of cosine similarity angle theta
    show histogram and other descriptive statistics of the angel data
    
-- Bayesian formulation
    why Bayesian
    the type of analysis question
    choice of likelihood function
    choice of prior distributions
    
-- Results analysis
    Tools: PyMC3, MCMC, NUTS
    Describe fitted values & convergence (trace plots)
    Describe effect size analysis for comparing Likert and QV
    Describe effect size analysis for comparing across QVs
